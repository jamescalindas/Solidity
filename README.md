# Project: Create a Token

The goal of this project is to utilize the knowledge and skills acquired from the Metacrafters online course on Solidity. By creating a token, students will demonstrate their understanding and practical application of the concepts learned.

## Description

This project is designed to highlight the practical skills and comprehensive understanding gained from the Metacrafters Solidity course. The main task is to develop a token using Solidity, showcasing the ability to write smart contracts, deploy them on a blockchain, and manage tokens in a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

### Executing the Program

To run the program, Transfer your Solidity code for the token to Remix - Ethereum IDE. Remix is an easy-to-use tool with a graphical interface for developing smart contracts.  Deploy your token in the Remix virtual environment to observe its functionality.
